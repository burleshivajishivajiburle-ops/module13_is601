# Development Reflection: JWT Calculator Platform

This project involved building a FastAPI application with JWT authentication, front-end templates, and comprehensive testing using Playwright for end-to-end automation. The main development challenges included implementing secure JWT token generation with PyJWT library, setting up PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy models and bcrypt password hashing, and creating responsive HTML templates with JavaScript validation. The testing strategy utilized Playwright E2E automation to cover registration flows, login authentication, and error handling scenarios, while the CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions automated testing and Docker Hub deployment. Technical challenges centered around environment management using Docker containers and implementing proper error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes for authentication failures.

The most valuable learning experience was understanding how different testing layers work together to ensure application reliability, from unit tests to integration tests to end-to-end browser automation. Key insights gained include the importance of security best practices like bcrypt password hashing, JWT token expiration mechanisms, and input validation on both client and server sides. The project demonstrated how Docker Compose simplifies local development setup, how CI/CD pipelines provide deployment confidence, and how Playwright testing catches integration issues that unit tests miss. Areas for future improvement include enhanced security with rate limiting, better user experience through password reset functionality, and performance optimizations with caching strategies.
